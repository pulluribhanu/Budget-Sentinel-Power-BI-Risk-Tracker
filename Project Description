Project Name:
"Budget Sentinel: Power BI Risk Tracker"

Project Description:
This project aims to design a data-driven dashboard system that identifies departments and projects at risk of exceeding budgets or underperforming. The process involves constructing a comprehensive SQL database, integrating data from multiple organizational sources (employees, salaries, departments, and projects), and developing dynamic SQL queries. The final result is a Power BI dashboard that delivers real-time insights into departmental efficiency, project health, salary distribution, and potential risk areas. Special focus is given to evaluating whether department budgets—set on a 2-year cycle—can sustain all operational costs within a fiscal year.

Project Outcome:
A robust SQL database schema unifying departmental, salary, and project data.

Custom SQL queries to classify projects by status and associate them with departments and employees.

A Power BI dashboard that:

Flags underperforming or overbudget projects/departments.

Visualizes employee performance metrics.

Shows salary distribution across roles.

Supports informed decision-making around budget allocation and project management.

Project Workflow Recap:
Build the Database – Consolidate employee, salary, department, and project data.

Develop SQL Queries – Create logic to merge completed and upcoming project statuses and join this with employee and department data.

Connect to Power BI – Use SQL views/queries to import clean, analytical datasets into Power BI.

Build a Dashboard – Visualize risks, budget consumption, and project performance effectively.

Key SQL Component Explanation:
SQL Code Summary:

The project_status CTE combines upcoming and completed projects into one unified table with a status tag.

The final SELECT joins employee data with their project assignments and project status to create a comprehensive view of who is working on what, under which department, and how projects are performing.

Two-line Insight:

This SQL script creates a unified view of employee assignments across both upcoming and completed projects, enriched with salary and department context. It serves as the backbone for identifying high-risk projects or teams that may be overbudget or underdelivering.
